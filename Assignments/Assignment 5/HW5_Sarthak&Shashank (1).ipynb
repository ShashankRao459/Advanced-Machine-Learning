        "## Part 1 (6 points)\n",
        "Why are skip connections useful in CNN architectures like ResNet? (*Hint: think about gradient propagation in very deep networks*)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Answer\n",
        "Skip connections, as utilized in architectures like ResNet, are integral to addressing the challenges associated with training deep neural networks, particularly the vanishing gradient problem. By allowing the gradients to bypass intermediate layers through residual connections, they facilitate improved gradient propagation during backpropagation. This mechanism ensures that information from earlier layers is preserved, enabling the network to learn residual mappings instead of directly modeling the underlying function. This approach simplifies optimization, mitigates the degradation problem (where deeper networks perform worse), and enhances the overall representational capacity of the network, making it more effective in learning complex hierarchical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 2 (7 points)\n",
        "How does batch normalization improve training in CNNs, and why is it generally used after a convolutional layer but before the activation function?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Answer\n",
        "Batch normalization significantly enhances training efficiency in CNNs by normalizing the input features to each layer based on the mean and variance computed across mini-batches. This normalization reduces the internal covariate shift, where the distribution of inputs to a layer changes during training, thus stabilizing the optimization process. It also enables the use of higher learning rates and acts as a regularizer, reducing overfitting. Batch normalization is typically applied after the convolutional layer but before the activation function to ensure that the normalized features are effectively scaled and shifted prior to applying non-linear transformations. This placement optimizes the learning dynamics and enhances the network's generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 3 (7 points)\n",
        "Explain how the concept of translation invariance is achieved in CNNs and why it is an important property for visual recognition tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Answer\n",
        "Translation invariance in CNNs is achieved through convolutional and pooling operations. Convolutional layers use shared weights and biases to detect patterns across different spatial locations, ensuring that the learned features are position-independent. Pooling layers, such as max pooling or average pooling, further contribute to translation invariance by summarizing feature activations within localized regions, reducing the sensitivity of the model to small positional variations in the input. This property is fundamental for visual recognition tasks as it allows the model to consistently recognize objects and patterns regardless of their spatial orientation or position within the image. Consequently, translation invariance enhances the robustness, generalization, and applicability of CNNs in real-world scenarios."

        "\n",
        "### Part 1 (5 points)\n",
        "Consider the example we saw in the class w.r.t Contrastive Learning (CL). We had two Cat images (say $C_1$, $C_2$) and one Bicycle image($B_1$), which we used for CL. However, if we only had one Cat image($C_1$) and one Bicycle image($B_1$), can we still do Contrastive Learning? If no, why?\n",
        "\n",
        "If yes, how? (ie, what will be my reference sample, positive sample, and negative sample?)\n",
        "### Answer\n",
        "Yes, it is feasible to perform contrastive learning with one Cat image (\n",
        "𝐶1\n",

        "𝐶1\n",
        "​\n",
        " ) serves as the reference sample, while a positive sample is generated by applying transformations such as random cropping, rotation, flipping, or adding Gaussian noise. These augmentations ensure that the semantic content of the image remains intact while providing a varied version of it. The Bicycle image (\n",
        "𝐵1\n",
        "​\n",
        " ) acts as the negative sample, representing a semantically dissimilar image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The contrastive learning objective in this scenario is to maximize the similarity between the embeddings of the reference image (\n",

        "𝐵1\n",
        "​\n",
        " ). While this approach allows for the application of contrastive learning with minimal labeled data, its effectiveness may be limited due to the lack of diversity in the positive samples. Nonetheless, it highlights the adaptability of contrastive learning in scenarios where labeled data or a variety of samples is constrained.\n",
        "### Part 2 (5 points)\n",
        "We need labelled data for contrastive learning. True or False? Can you think of a real world example where contrastive learning is a better choice compared to the conventional training approach? (Caution: If you use ChatGPT to answer this question you might end up giving same example as other students)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer\n",
        "False. Contrastive learning does not inherently require labeled data, as it often operates in a self-supervised paradigm. Positive pairs are typically generated through data augmentation, ensuring that semantically similar representations are learned, while negative pairs are sampled from other instances in the dataset. This methodology enables contrastive learning to be particularly effective in domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
        "\n",
        "A real-world example Contrastive learning would be for improving autonomous vehicle systems, as it enables robust generalization to diverse real-world scenarios like varying weather, lighting, and road conditions. By using positive pairs (e.g., different views of the same stop sign) and negative pairs (e.g., a stop sign vs. a yield sign), the model learns to embed similar scenes closer together and dissimilar ones further apart in latent space. This reduces reliance on extensive labeled datasets, enhances recognition of rare or partially visible scenarios, and scales efficiently to new environments. This method ensures safer and more reliable performance for autonomous driving systems while streamlining data processing and model adaptation.\n",

        "Contrastive learning has significantly improved the quality of embeddings by enhancing the separation between positive and negative pairs. Before contrastive learning, the positive pair (\\(C1\\) and \\(C2\\)) exhibited a high cosine similarity of \\(0.9193\\), indicating some closeness in the original representation. However, the negative pairs (\\(C1\\) and \\(B1\\); \\(C2\\) and \\(B1\\)) had similarities of \\(0.1696\\) and \\(0.1561\\), suggesting insufficient separation between dissimilar items in the latent space. This implies that the pre-contrastive learning embeddings were not fully optimized for distinguishing between similar and dissimilar items.\n",
        "\n",
        "After contrastive learning, the model has clearly learned to create a more meaningful representation space. The cosine similarity for the positive pair increased to \\(0.9980\\), showing near-perfect clustering of similar items. Conversely, the similarities for negative pairs dropped significantly to \\(0.0626\\) and \\(0.0586\\), demonstrating a stronger divergence between dissimilar items. These results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive learning in refining embeddings, making it more suitable for applications like similarity search, clustering, or classification."

Initially, the embeddings of the positive pair (\"Cat C1\" and \"Cat C2\") are relatively close, reflecting some recognition of similarity by the model. However, the negative pair (\"Bicycle B1\" and the \"Cat\" embeddings) is not significantly far apart, indicating that the model struggles to effectively separate dissimilar classes in the latent space.\n",

Meanwhile, the embedding for the negative pair (\"Bicycle B1\") moves further away from the \"Cat\" embeddings, showcasing the model's enhanced ability to distinguish between dissimilar items. This separation highlights the effectiveness of contrastive learning in refining the embedding space.\n",
